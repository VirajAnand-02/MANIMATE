To multiply two matrices, say A and B, the number of *columns* in A must equal the number of *rows* in B. If A is an m x n matrix and B is an n x p matrix, the resulting matrix C will be an m x p matrix.",

Understanding these properties is key to using matrix multiplication effectively. Keep practicing, and you'll master this powerful tool!",
