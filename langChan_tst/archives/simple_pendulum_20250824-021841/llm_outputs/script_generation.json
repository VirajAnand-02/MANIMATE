      "text": "A simple pendulum consists of a mass, often called a 'bob', suspended from a fixed point by a light string or rod. We assume the string is massless and doesn't stretch. When the bob is pulled back and released, gravity pulls it downwards, causing it to swing back and forth. This motion is called oscillation.",

      "text": "The period of a pendulum, represented by 'T', is the time it takes for one complete swing – from one extreme position back to the same extreme position. A key factor influencing the period is the length of the pendulum, 'L'. Longer pendulums have longer periods. Another crucial factor is the acceleration due to gravity, 'g'.",

      "text": "Interestingly, the mass of the bob itself doesn't significantly affect the period of a *simple* pendulum, assuming the angle of swing is small. This is a key characteristic. The angle of swing also plays a role; the formula we showed is most accurate for small angles, typically less than 15 degrees.",

While real-world pendulums might have some friction or air resistance, the simple pendulum model provides a valuable approximation for many situations.
