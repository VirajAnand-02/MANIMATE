An arrow points from the 'n' of Matrix A to the 'n' of Matrix B, then another arrow goes from A and B to a new Matrix C (m x p) which is then highlighted. Show an example with actual numbers: A(2x3) and B(3x2) resulting in C(2x2).",

An equation showing the dot product calculation appears: (A11 * B11) + (A12 * B21) + (A13 * B31) = C11, with C11 being the first element of Matrix C, which appears on the screen.",
