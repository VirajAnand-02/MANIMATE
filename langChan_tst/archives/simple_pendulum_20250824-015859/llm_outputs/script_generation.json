      "text": "A simple pendulum consists of a point mass, or 'bob', suspended from a fixed point by a massless, inextensible string. In reality, we use a small, dense object attached to a light string. The key is that the mass of the bob is much larger than the mass of the string.",

      "text": "The pendulum's motion is governed by gravity. When displaced from its resting position, gravity pulls the bob back towards equilibrium. This creates a restoring force that causes the pendulum to oscillate or swing back and forth.",

      "text": "The time it takes for one complete swing, going back and forth, is called the period. Interestingly, the period of a simple pendulum depends primarily on its length and the acceleration due to gravity. The mass of the bob has almost no effect!",

      "text": "The period (T) can be calculated using the formula: T = 2π√(L/g), where L is the length of the pendulum and g is the acceleration due to gravity. This formula is an approximation that works well for small angles of displacement. For larger angles, the motion becomes more complex!",
